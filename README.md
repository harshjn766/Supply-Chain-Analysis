# Supply-Chain-Analysis

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of supply chain data using Python, with a focus on data visualization using the Pyplot library. This project demonstrated my ability to leverage Python for supply chain analytics and create compelling visualizations for effective decision-making.

I utilized Pyplot, a powerful data visualization library within Matplotlib, to create a wide variety of charts and graphs. These visualizations included bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more.\

Also analyzed the deficit rate at the end of the analysis.
